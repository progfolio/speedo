* Speedo: Lightweight Emacs Split timer ðŸ©²
Speedo is a lightweight [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun][speedrun]] split timer.

** DEMO                                                             :ignore:

** Motivation
I was not satisfied with the native split timer options for Linux.
Running a split timer in a browser is an option, but caused hiccups during game play due to how CPU intensive they were.
I also wanted record more information than the average split timer in order to develop tools to aid speed running practice.

** File Format
Speedo stores game settings and data in an elisp plist.
This makes it easy to read and interact with programmatically.
An example database:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical t
( :title "TITLE"
  :category "CATEGORY"
  :segments ((:name "One")
             (:name "Two")
             (:name "Three"))
  :attempts
  ;; a run (complete attempt)
  (( :start "2020-01-01 00:00"
     :splits (( :segment "One"   :duration "1:00.33")
              ( :segment "Two"   :duration "1:33.45")
              ( :segment "Three" :duration "2:41")))
   ;; an incomplete attempt
   ( :start "2020-01-01 00:00"
     :splits (( :segment "One"   :duration "1:00.24")
              ( :segment "Two"   :duration "2:33.08"
                :mistakes ("2:03.35")))
     :reset "3:25.75"))
  :config
  ;; game specific customizations
  ((setq speedo-buffer "*My Buffer Title*")))
#+end_src
